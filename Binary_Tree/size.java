/*
Given a binary tree of size N, you have to count number of nodes in it. For example, count of nodes in below tree is 4.

        1
     /      \
   10      39
  /
5

Input:
First line of input contains the number of test cases T. For each test case, there will be only a single line of input which is a string representing the tree as described below: 

The values in the string are in the order of level order traversal of the tree where, numbers denote node values, and a character “N” denotes NULL child.

For example:

For the above tree, the string will be: 1 2 3 N N 4 6 N 5 N N 7 N

Output:
For each testcase in new line, print the number of nodes.
